green infrastructure services 
leading the way in constructing green technology  
 
 
green roofs 
green roofs are veneers of living systems used on top of 
buildings. composed of light weight media and  
vegetation,  green  roofs  provide  many  environmental 
benefits including managing storm water at the source. 
 
 
rain gardens 
rain gardens are subtle depressions in the landscape that 
collect water. while supporting a wonderful variety of 
native plants, rain gardens also slow down the  
movement of water and promote infiltration. 
 
 
bio swales 
bio swales, much like rain gardens, are natural  
systems used to convey the flow of water through the 
landscape. bio swales are naturally vegetated to  
stabilize the soil and prevent erosion while proving  
valuable habitat. bio swales can be integrated with rain 
gardens in the creation of a chain of  
best management practices.

living retaining walls 
living retaining walls are vegetated walls used when a 
change in grade is required. living retaining walls  
include planting pockets that allow for appropriate  
vegetation  to  grow  integral  with  the  wall  providing 
beauty as well as many environmental benefits. 
 
 
green walls 
green walls are vertical surfaces composed of  
vegetation used in conjunction with building facades. 
green walls include integral irrigation systems that  
support the growth of plants. greens walls provide  
environmental benefits including cleansing of the water 
and filtration of the air. 
 
 
porous paving 
porous paving systems are designed and constructed to 
promote the infiltration of water. porous paving is  
suitable for parking areas, terraces and walkways and 
reduces runoff that causes erosion of natural systems.

native species 
david brothers native plant nursery considers as native species 
those plants that existed in the south eastern pennsylvania re-
gion before european settlement. native species are adapted to 
the region and integral to the wildlife of the area. due to climate 
change we consider southern species and others that border our 
region and will naturally migrate to be acceptable native species 
to this region.

non-native species 
non-native species are plants introduced to the region. 
non-native plants are marked with an *. 
 
invasive species 
invasive species are plants that have aggressive reproductive 
characteristics and often displace preferable native species re-
sulting in a loss of  bio-diversity. the spread of invasive species 
is responsible for the loss and decline of many of our native 
landscapes. invasive species should not be utilized in gardens or 
the landscape in order to prevent them from spreading into sur-
rounding areas. invasive species should be removed from the 
landscape when feasible and otherwise managed to prevent seed 
dispersal and reproduction.

cultivars 
cultivars are plants, selected for particular attributes, that are 
clearly distinct, uniform, and stable and that retain these  
characteristics when propagated by appropriate means. there 
are many cultivars of native species selected for their unique 
attributes. 
 
hybrids 
hybrids are a cross between different clones within a species  
or between clones from different species that together represent 
unique characteristics.  many native species will naturally  
hybridize while other hybrids are induced by horticultural  
processes. 
 
monoecious 
monoecious plants are those that have both the male and  
female organs on the same individual plant. monoecious plants 
only require one individual plant for pollination and fruiting  
to take place. 
 
dioecious 
dioecious plants are those that have the male and female  
organs on separate individual plants.  both a male plant and a 
female plant are required for pollination and fruiting to take 
place. the ilex (holly) species is a prime example of  
dioecious plants. 
 
david brothers native plant nursery is committed to informing 
our patrons about the use of native species in the landscape.
