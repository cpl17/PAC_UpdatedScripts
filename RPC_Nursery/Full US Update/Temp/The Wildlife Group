Bargain plants may not be healthy, or maybe a variety not adapted to your area. Buy only trees of recommended varieties from a reliable source. Remember these few points when purchasing trees: ❧ Healthy one-year whips 3’-4’ tall ½” to ¾” diameter are preferred ❧ Healthy container plants 4’-8’ tall 1” to 2” diameter ❧ Small trees with a sound root system are more desirable ❧ Do not purchase trees that appear stunted, poorly grown, or diseased ❧ Closely check labels to make sure of variety and rootstock. Site and Soil Requirements Sunlight is the critical ingredient in maximizing fruit production. Early morning sun is crucial to dry the dew from the plants, thereby reducing disease incidence. So choose a site on your property that is in the sun most of the day. Otherwise, expect reduced performance from your trees. Well-drained soil is more important than soil fertility. Avoid soils where the water still stands 24 hours after a good rain. In these areas, the roots will die from a lack of oxygen. If you are forced to plant in these areas, you must plant on raised or terraced beds. Lastly, do not plant Apple Trees in highly alkaline soils. Apples develop many minor element problems when planted on high PH soils. Pollination Not all fruit trees require pollen from other varieties to set fruit. But remember that fruit trees produce larger and sweeter crops when cross-pollinated with suitable varieties. It is always best to plant two or more varieties with overlapping bloom periods. Some types bear heavy crops when pollinated by another pollen-producing variety. Mixing varieties and plants in multiples is imperative to ensure that pollination is not an issue. Pruning and Training The day you plant your trees is when you begin to prune and train for future production. Neglect results in poor growth and delayed fruiting. ❧ 1st year – Pruning a young tree controls its shape by developing a robust, well-balanced framework of scaffold branches. Remove or cut back unwanted branches early to avoid the necessity of signifi ant cuts in later years. Remove inside crossing limbs as well as heading the central leader. Heading brings the top and the roots back into balance and causes buds below the cut to grow and form scaffold branches. ❧ 2nd year – Again, top the central leader to encourage another group of scaffolding branches. Remove all inside limbs and tip prune all existing stems. Limb spreaders are encouraged to get the desired spread of limbs (45-degree angle with the main Trunk); this increases sunlight to the interior portion of the tree. Remember to keep the central leader as the highest point on the tree and keep the ends of the scaffold branches and primary limbs below the top of the tree—prune trees every year in February. Fertilization At planting time, dig a larger-than-average hole to soften the surrounding soils. A giant hole will allow the root system to spread quickly. Place the recommended number of Best Paks all-season 20-10-5 fertilizer at the edge of each hole about halfway up from the bottom of the hole. Cover the root system and water if possible. The second growing season, on the 1st of March, double the amount of Best Pak all-season fertilizer. Take a shovel, slice into the soil, and drop in the recommended number of paks around the tree’s dripline to fertilize for that year. If you are in an area where fi e blight has been a problem, Cut your application rates by 1/2 on Apples and Crabapples. Pears do not require much fertilizer, so if you have any doubts about pears, do not fertilize them. Treat persimmons much like you would pears. Soil Testing is the most overlooked aspect in any planting situation. 3 Weed Control One of the most limiting factors for all newly planted trees is weeds. Weed competition can result in death or poor growth of young trees. Keep a 3-4’ circle cleaned at the base of each tree; you can accomplish this by mulching and using weed fabric or chemicals. When using chemicals, please read labels and use only recommended mixing rates. Be careful not to get it on the tree or saturate the ground. Combining a pre-emergent with the roundup is also very benefic al to prohibit regrowth for approximately three months. Again “Weeds are the most limiting factor for newly planted trees.” Spraying Strive to pick the most disease-resistant trees that you can get to help with the problems that may arise while you are gone. However, resistance does not mean immunity, so some spraying may sometimes be necessary. We strongly recommend spraying dormant oil (Horticultural oil) mixed with 1 ounce of Permethrin on your fruit trees once a season in February on a warm sunny day. Winter spraying will smother mites and insect eggs that would emerge later to cause damage to your trees. Permethrin will also contact kill and have a 30-60 day residual kill. Permethrin will also kill Ambrosia beetle along Camphor shot borers that overwinter in your trees and emerge in the spring. Never spray insecticides on your trees while they are blooming. Doing this will kill benefic al pollinating insects. We also recommend a systemic drench for edibles. Bayer Citrus and Vegetable Insect control can be used on all of your mast-producing trees. Th s soil drench gives season-long prevention against aphids, beetles, whiteflies, cales, psyllids, leafhoppers, and thrips. A more robust version for hardwood trees that are not be used for human consumption is also available. Th s dual-action formula delivers 12 months of insect protection and slow-release fertilizer feed. These products can also be purchased where you get your trees and at local Lowes and Home Depot stores. In Summation ❧ Purchase your trees from a reputable company. Remember that buying trees is a long-term relationship, much like purchasing a piece of land. The trees that you plant on your property will benefit you and your family for a long time. ❧ Soil Test ❧ Diversify -plant varying species of Apples, Crabapples, Pears, Persimmons, and Plums for pollination and a sustained fruit drop from early summer into late December. ❧ Spend a little time with your trees each season in late February, removing old dead limbs, crossing limbs inside the tree, and heading back to the leaders. Remember to make pruning cuts above outward-facing buds. ❧ Fertilization- always lean on the side of a little is enough. Remember that Pears and Persimmon do not require much nitrogen, especially after about three-four years. Fertilization during the early years is benefic al in establishing young trees and soil testing for correct PH. ❧ Weeds – use weed mats, spray, and mulch weeds are the most limiting factor to establishing newly planted trees. ❧ Dormant oil on a warm February day will help prevent insect damage. The 1st and most crucial spray that can be applied to fruit trees, in my opinion, and is the least toxic of all sprays. (Neem Oil is excellent and is organic) ❧ Lastly, be patient! We constantly hear someone tell us that the nursery told me they have trees that will produce in 2-3 years. Well, we do, but in reality, even if buying large trees, you will still have about a 4 – 5-year window that the tree must develop a sound limb structure and a healthy, thriving root system. Only then will you start to benefit fully from your orchard. So plant with a long-term purpose in mind and only plant as many trees as you can care for each season. 4 FRUIT TREE SELECTION Planting fruit trees on your property for enjoyment as well as creating a food source for wildlife is a little more involved than just stopping by the local Wal-Mart and picking up a tree. Several factors are considered before choosing or planting fruit trees. 1) Pick trees that you know will produce in your area. Someone at the nursery will help you with that. If they cannot help with this information, you are in the wrong place. 2) Choose healthy plant stock, whether you are choosing bare root or container trees. 3) Plant different varieties of apples, crabapples, pears, and plums in groups to aid in pollination. Never plant just one variety. 4) Always plant during the winter season when the plants are dormant to decrease transplanting shock and to increase survivability. 5) Dig a nice big hole to spread the roots and water thoroughly at planting to remove all air pockets. Here at The Wildlife Group, we have done your homework for you. We have selected over 30 varieties of fruit trees that we feel have the desirable traits needed for planting and producing on your property. Desirable traits that we believe are most important include different drop & bloom times, disease resistance, quality root stock and ease of growth. We are currently offering many varieties of fruit trees for wildlife that when planted in groups will drop fruit from July until late December. Typically these trees will produce within three to five years of the planting date depending upon variety. If you are looking for quicker production, we offer larger plants in 7 Gallon & 15-gallon containers. The container plants range in price from $35.00 to $60.00. 5 Tips from The Wildlife Group! 1) Pears are the easiest fruit tree to grow. 2) Crabapples do a great job pollinating apples 3) Purchasing fruit trees in packages aids in pollination and saves you money. 4) Make a plan now so that you can get your trees planted before February for best results. 5) Planting container plants in November & December gives you the best chance for success 6) Always use Plantra Jump Start Tree Tubes & Fiberglass stakes on all your bare root fruit trees or oak seedlings. 7) On larger container trees either protect with a wire cage, plastic mesh enclosure, or trunk protectors from Plantra. Most importantly protect your trees deer will eat everything they can reach. 6 COMPLETE FRUIT TREE PACKAGES When designing a permanent food plot, I'm asked how many trees I can put on an acre. One Acre is roughly a football fi ld minus the end zone. So, let's assume we are spacing every tree on thirty-foot centers. One Acre is 43,560 sq ft, 30 x 30 = 900, 900 divided by 43,560 = 48.40. You could feasibly put 48 fruit trees on an Acre at 30 ft pacing and still have room for a boarded lane around the fi ld. Mixing different types of fruit in these areas will provide months of food, great Pollination, and help concentrate wildlife in a permanent plot. Packages are designed for extended drop dates and overlapping Pollination.

Th u comprehensive study and selection, we feel that we are offering the highest quality of varieties with outstanding disease resistance for your property. Along with carefully selected apple varieties, we are also very cautious about using the best rootstock. That is why we have chosen to use MM111 on southern Apples and Crabapples, and Bud 118 on Northern varieties for colder climates. What is Rootstock? The rootstock is a plant, sometimes just a stump of the plant, with an established healthy root system, which we use for grafting or budding. The part of the plant being grafted or budded is called the scion. Both parts play an integral role in the makeup of the new plant. The rootstock is chosen for its vigor and disease-resistant qualities. The scion is chosen for the plant characteristics desired by the grower. For example, we selected the Callaway Crabapple for the desired fruit for animals and the drop time. The bud from the Callaway put on MM111 rootstock gives the tree excellent disease resistance, abundant fruit production, and desirable drop dates. The MM111 will also allow for varying planting sites and can withstand moist soil. Fruit trees can only be replicated thru this process. The seed from the fruit will not produce the Callaway.

New data indicates a general warming trend in winter temperatures, which has resulted in some changes in zone categorization. The USDA plant hardiness zones are to be used as a general guideline for planting. You should be aware that there are other factors that will affect the hardiness of a plant which includes wind, soil type, humidity, snow and moisture.

We also recommend using fibe glass stakes. A great stake is as important as a great tube! 24 AU BUCK CHESTNUT SEEDLINGS The AU Buck Chestnuts are late dropping heavy-producing chestnuts. The trees that we collect seeds from are here on our property. The trees got our attention while doing fi ld analysis with Auburn University for drop date, annual crop yield, and nut viability for the commercial chestnut market. Although, all of the trees did not meet the strict guidelines of the retail quality market. They did meet the requirements of all of the deer in our area. The AU Bucks are heavy producers of medium to large nuts and desirable later drop dates than standard chestnuts. Th s season we are offering the seedling trees only because of their viability over the grafted trees. The AU Bucks are in an exclusive area pollinating each other, hopefully keeping the exact characteristics of the parent trees. Grown Exclusively in 1 gallon Root Pouches AU Buck III Seedling $25.00 ea. AU Buck IV Seedling $25.00 ea. AU Gobbler Seedling $25.00 ea. Care Tips: *Plantra Tree Tubes and stakes should be used on all of the AU Buck Trees. *Please remember that it’s imperative to clean tree tubes out twice per season and to prune suckers that will grow from the rootstock below the graft. *Be patient chestnuts do not grow vigorously the 1st season while taking root.

GROWN EXCLUSIVELY IN 3 GALLON ROOT POUCH CONTAINER 3 GAL $35.00 CHINESE CHIQUAPIN {Castanea Seguinii} USDA Zones 6-9 HABITAT: Prefers a well-drained, slightly acidic soil and thrives in dry soils. Once established is very drought tolerant. Th ives in areas with hot, humid summers. An excellent soil-enriching understory plant found in a pine forest. The disease-resistant Sequin is an incredible plant that produces yearly and abundantly, offering a high protein food source from September well into November. The nuts from the Sequin are not only nutritious but also highly palatable to wildlife. The Sequins typically bloom in mid-may; therefore, late spring frost rarely damages the fl wers, thus ensuring a great crop every year. The plant will normally have two to three flushes of vegetative growth per season. The nut is similar to the chestnut in that it is high in starches & sugar but low in fats. The M&M sized morsels will begin to drop around the 1st of September and persist well into November. The Sequin is a vigorous grower and an early producer typically producing small chestnuts during the second growing season. Because of the burst of vegetative growth throughout the growing season and late into the fall, the Sequin will show signs of tip dieback. The reason this happens is because of continual blooms that last into the 1st frost, thus damaging the tips of soft tissue on the fresh new growth at the end of the limbs. It appears to have no natural damaging effect on the overall health of the plant and is not as noticeable once the plant matures. The Turkey & Deer devour the small chestnuts.

The only problems that we have had with any Felco product are them disappearing. 32 PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS Seedling care At no point when handling your plants allow the roots to dry out. Th s applies to fall, winter, and spring plantings. We do not suggest any plantings during the summer months. Plant seedlings as soon as you can upon receiving them. If it is possible to plant your tree seedlings within one week of receiving them, leave them in the original package and store them in a cool place out of direct sunlight. Check the roots every couple of days to make sure they are moist. Do not allow the seedlings to freeze or remain in an area that could get too hot. If at any time you feel the seedlings need moisture, wet some paper towels or newspaper and wrap around the roots in the box to retain moisture. Another way to store your seedlings is to heel them in; this works well for more extended storage. Dig a trench in the ground deep enough and wide enough to insert the bundle of seedlings’ roots into the ground and cover it with soil. Next, you want to water the ground to settle the earth and keep it moist. Next, I would like you to water the seedlings at least once a week unless you have had adequate rain. The seedling’s roots will keep moist much longer, and you can remove and plant them as needed. Planting Your Trees The hole you prepare is as important as the seedling you are planting. The hole you dig will need to be deep and wide enough to place the seedling without j-rooting easily or smashing the roots together. Please make sure the hole is deep enough so that you can plant your trees at the same depth that they were in the nursery. You will see a slight color change from the tree trunk to the root system. Plant at that depth, maybe a bit deeper, but do not leave any roots above ground. All fruit trees will grow better on well-drained soils. Some oaks are suited for wetter soils and will do great, but not all trees will grow in moist bottomland. Sunlight is essential for most trees and plants. Plant in full sun where possible, and remember that morning sun is more important than evening sun, so if you get 4-6 hours of sunlight, plant for morning sun if possible. Again wet soils are not acceptable for fruit trees. Most of all concerns, take your time and plant your trees right. Rushing through causes poor plantings and thus results in poor results. I had rather you plant fewer trees and plant them right. Set up a five-year plan for your property and plant in sections to give your trees extra care in the 1st season. Tree Spacing Oak and Chestnut plant spacing recommendation at 25-35 ft. lant in groups to ensure pollination and give more extensive support of food in the area once the trees start to produce. Chestnuts typically start producing within 5-7 years. Oak trees will vary widely depending upon species. Early producing oaks include Sawtooth, Gobbler Sawtooth, Chinkapin Oaks, 33 Call and place your order today 1.800.221.9703 Dwarf Chinkapin Oaks, Live oaks, and water oak. From experience with the above species, you could have acorns with 5-8 years on the above species. Always use tree tubes and a quality fiberglass stake to ensure survival and increase growth. Fruit trees should be spaced 15-25ft de ending upon species. Apples and crabs are sometimes planted closer because of differing rootstocks; this is because of the semi-dwarfi g rootstock on many species. Always check with your grower to fi d out what rootstock they are using. If plants are grafted on wild apple rootstock space at least 20ft part, pears grow much larger and faster, so the minimum spacing would be 20 ft. t’s best to plant fruit trees in groups mixing apples and crabs to aid in pollination. Also, plant pears together and mix varieties for pollination. Planting different fruit trees in the same area gives you excellent pollination and offers an extended drop of fruit. Keep in mind that some fruit trees will produce within three years; this is not always optimum because heavy fruiting slows the growth and can damage trees. Most fruit trees will be large enough to withstand a good fruit crop about five years after planting. Finishing up Planting trees can be a gratifying project for you, your property, and hunting members, and a great family outing. Seeing the results of your labor is very rewarding. Following our recommendations, we expect you to have 90% survival or better. Thi gs will happen out of your control, and you will lose some trees; it happens to us also. Be patient and give them time to grow and mature; you will reap the rewards for years. PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS 34 DISEASE AND PEST CONTROL MEASURES I have spoken with customers about using the Dormant spray in many articles and numerous times throughout the season. Applying dormant oil to all your fruit trees before Spring bud break is the 1st part of a great spray regimen. We recommend a solid coating of dormant oil on the entire tree from to bottom if possible. Keep in mind that spraying is a crucial step in caring for all fruiting trees, including berry plants, plums, and vines. Secondly, applying a coating of fi e blight spray during bloom on pear and apple trees will help tremendously stop the spread of fi e blight. Fire blight is a bacterial infection that affects Pears and some apples. No other spray is typically sprayed on trees while in bloom except streptomycin sulfate to control fi e blight. The best application process would include early morning or late afternoon spraying to avoid disturbing bees and other benefic al insects. Fertilome Fire Blight Spray is what we would recommend. After the fl wers turn and the petals drop, it is time to apply a copper fungicide for leaf spots, rot, and fungus that can affect the trees. After the summer temps begin to reach 85 and above during daylight, you can start applying pest and disease sprays to your growing season. Again remember that it is always best to spray early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid contacting bees and benefic al insects. Neem oil is an excellent Organic insecticide used here at the nursery. We use it on fruit trees, fl wers, berry plants, and vegetables. It’s natural, safe, and can also be used as a dormant spray. Please keep this in mind when using any product. Please follow all label instructions, wear protective clothing, and do not use around children and pets.
